# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Prediction-using-Histopathology-Images-by Transfer-Learning
This project aims to classify and predict Histopathology Images of cells to identify whether or not it is IDC positive or negative. The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle.
The resnet architecture has been used first. After that tranfer learning was done by using the Inception V3 network pretrained model. Both the models were trained and tested on batch datasets as well as individual images.
